## What's New (User Facing)
 * Create Account authentication

 * Forgot Password authentication 

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
**Team LD** has worked on integration of both the front-end and the back-end for **SCALE _Pathways_ Mobile**. Firstly, we have completed the authentication for user Create-Account, Sign-In, Forgot-Password, and Log-Out. The app is able to make the correct HTTP request for these four functionalities, updating and reading from the back-end accordingly. A user is able to Sign-In, Create-Account, Log-Out, and perform Forgot-Password from the mobile application.
